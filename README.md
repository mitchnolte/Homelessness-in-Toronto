## Introduction
Homelessness is a serious issue that affects people all around the world, and in Toronto the issue is especially significant as the city is the centre of the housing crisis in Southern Ontario. This report is an analysis of the Toronto Shelter System Flow data set. The data set was published by the Shelter, Support & Housing Administration, which is a division of Toronto’s municipal government. It can be accessed from https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-shelter-system-flow/. This data set is about homeless people in Toronto that use city-funded shelter services. It was collected from the Shelter Management Information System (SMIS), which is used by the services to take people into their programs. The downside of this collection method is that it only provides data about people who use city-funded services, so it excludes homeless people who utilize other services and those who do not utilize any services whatsoever. This makes developing an understanding of the entire homeless population of the city impossible with this data set alone. Despite this limitation, we believe it is the most reliable data available about homelessness in Toronto as it was produced by the city’s government.
